# AI Programming Tasks Overview

## Introduction

This repository contains a series of programming tasks focused on various aspects of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These tasks cover a range of topics from basic Python programming to complex AI techniques like reinforcement learning and symbolic AI. Each task is organized into separate directories, with initial commits showing the foundational code for each topic.

## Content Description

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific topic in AI programming, as outlined below:

### 01-aspects_of_python

This module introduces fundamental Python programming concepts that are essential for AI development. This includes data structures, control flow, and object-oriented programming.

### 02-search_problem_solving

Focuses on algorithms and strategies for solving search problems. This includes traditional search algorithms like depth-first and breadth-first searches, and applies these concepts to solve practical AI challenges.

### 03-reinforcement_learning

Covers the basics of reinforcement learning, including the setup of environments, agents, and reward mechanisms. Key algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients are explored and implemented.

### 04-perceptron

Introduces the perceptron learning algorithm, an early model for neural networks. This section delves into the mathematical foundations and practical implementations of a simple perceptron for binary classification tasks.

### 05-symbolic

Discusses symbolic AI, focusing on logic-based AI and knowledge representation. It includes tasks related to reasoning systems and the use of symbolic manipulation to solve AI problems.

### 06-sat_smt

Examines the use of SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) and SMT (satisfiability modulo theories) solvers in AI. These tools are critical for tasks that involve complex decision-making and problem-solving under constraints.

## Getting Started

To get started with these tasks, clone this repository and explore each directory. Each directory contains a standalone set of files that can be run to demonstrate the concepts discussed.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
